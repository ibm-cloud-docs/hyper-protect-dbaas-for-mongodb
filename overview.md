### Data security and confidentiality
{: #data_security}

Leveraging {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} LinuxONE pervasive encryption and [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Secure Service Container](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/secure-service-container){: external} technology, {{site.data.keyword.ihsdbaas_full}} provides workload isolation, restricted administrator access and tamper protection for data at rest and in flight. You can maintain complete control over your data; not even the cloud administrator has access to it at any point. For more information about security, see [Securing your data in {{site.data.keyword.ihsdbaas_mongodb_full}}](/docs/hyper-protect-dbaas-for-mongodb?topic=hyper-protect-dbaas-for-mongodb-mng-data).

### Highly available
{: #highly_available}

When you create a {{site.data.keyword.ihsdbaas_full}} service instance, you create a cluster that consists of one primary node and two secondary nodes (replicas that back up the primary). Each of them is installed in a unique Availability Zone with automatic daily backups in the local storage.

### Fully managed
{: #fully_managed}

{{site.data.keyword.ihsdbaas_full}} offers non-disruptive version upgrades, monitoring of the system by IBM SREs, and around-the-clock support from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can focus on building applications rather than managing availability, backups, logging, monitoring, scaling, hardware setup, and software patching.

### Developer friendly
{: #developer_friendly}

{{site.data.keyword.ihsdbaas_full}} provides standardized APIs to provision and monitor databases. Itâ€˜s easy for you to get started without the need for specialized database skills.
